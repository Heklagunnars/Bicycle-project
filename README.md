- Data from 60 min session, recorded every 10 minutes for 1 minute each time. 

Abstract
- At first glance, cycling can seem to be a simple
movement, but in reality, it is a complex motion
which requires a well refined technique in order
to reach it’s most efficient motion. Correcting cy-
cling techniques is of great importance for cyclists;
it can increase performance and decrease the risk
of injury. By combing results from previous stud-
ies on the optimal roadracing cycling technique
(i.e. ’Golden Loop’) and using electromyography
sensors (EMG) to detect muscle activation, it is
possible to analyse the cyclists technique and com-
pare it with the Golden Loop. A feedback system
that provides the cyclists with an overview of when
and how the muscles are activated has been created,
with the final goal of becoming a guiding technol-
ogy that enhances performances and informs of
weaknesses or injury risks.
